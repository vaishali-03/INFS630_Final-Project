# Project Title

 Predicting air temperature using multiple linear regression: a case study of McGill University

## Description

This project was done as part of INFS 630 - Data Mining course at McGill University. The purpose of this project was to predict air temperature around McGill University with the help of multiple linear regression when time and vegetation cover percentage are given.

The data for this project was obtained through multiple sensors intalled around the McGill campus by Prof. Raja Sengupta from Bieler School of Environment, Department of Geopgraphy for his research on Urban Heat Island. 

For data preparation and cleaning, model building and accuracy assessment; we used Python libraries and modules such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, time and datetime. All of these steps were done in jupyter notebooks.
